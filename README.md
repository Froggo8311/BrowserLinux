BrowserLinux is a web application aiming to enable a linux environment completely in the browser. The project currently has a pseudo-terminal for the linux environment.

Please contribute if you feel you can help the development of this software! We are currently looking for people who are willing to add improvements and changes.

A running version is available on [Vercel](https://browser-linux.vercel.app), although it does not have the ability to install `blpm` packages.
