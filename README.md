BrowserLinux is an application aiming to enable a linux environment completely in the browser. The project currently has a pseudo-terminal for the linux environment.

Contributions are welcomed and appreciated. Feel free to make pull requests.

A running version of this software is available at https://browserlinux.froggo8311.repl.co (If it shows a "running repl..." screen, just give it a minute then reload.)
